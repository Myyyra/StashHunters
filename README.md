<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About StashHunters

StashHunters was created during Haaga-Helia's Software Project II -course (10 ECTS) in spring 2021. It is a team project of five students.
</br></br>
StashHunters is a mobile game for hunting virtual stashes that other players have hidden. Stashes can be almost anything (like buildings, statues, landmarks, scenic views etc.). Stashes are hidden somewhere inside the areas visible on the map. Your job is to find the stash with the help of the stash picture without having the exact coordinates to the stash location.
</br></br>
You will find general instructions concerning StashHunters on this page. If you are interested in developing the game further, please refer to our Wiki for detailed information about technologies, installations and code of conduct.
