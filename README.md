<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About StashHunters

StashHunters was created during Haaga-Helia's Software Project II -course (10 ECTS) in spring 2021. It is a team project of five students.
</br></br>
StashHunters is a mobile game for hunting virtual stashes that other players have hidden. Stashes can be almost anything (like buildings, statues, landmarks, scenic views etc.). Stashes are hidden somewhere inside the areas visible on the map. Your job is to find the stash with the help of the stash picture without having the exact coordinates to the stash location.


### Building With

* [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
