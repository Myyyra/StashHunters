<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About StashHunters

StashHunters was created during Haaga-Helia's Software Project II -course (10 ECTS) in spring 2021. It is a team project of five students.
</br></br>
StashHunters is a mobile game for hunting virtual stashes that other players have hidden. Stashes can be almost anything (like buildings, statues, landmarks, scenic views etc.). Stashes are hidden somewhere inside the areas visible on the map. Your job is to find the stash with the help of the stash picture without having the exact coordinates to the stash location.
</br></br>
You will find general information and instructions concerning StashHunters on this page. If you are interested in developing the game further, please refer to our Wiki for detailed information about technologies, installations and code of conduct.


### Building With

* [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

We have established a development plan starting with a minimum viable product (MVP) and building up from there. You will find a list of features included in each version of the game in our wiki: https://github.com/Myyyra/StashHunters/wiki/Roadmap
</br></br>
We would love to hear your ideas and feature preferences for further developing the game, so don't hesitate to be in touch if you have any feedback about the game.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

For now the game operates only on Android devices.
</br></br>


### Prerequisites

The game requires permission to use location on your mobile device in order to function correctly.
</br></br>
If you wish to add new stashes to the game, you must create a user account and give the game permission to use the camera on your mobile device.

### Installation

For now the game is published only in Expo Go -application, and cannot be found in Google Play Store.
</br></br>
Install Expo Go to your mobile device: https://expo.io/

<!-- INSTRUCTIONS -->
## Instructions for players

You can find the latest published version of StashHunters from Expo Go: https://expo.io/@myyyrat/projects/stashhunt
</br></br>
You can hunt for stashes created by other players without creating a user account. Simply click "Continue without login" on the frontpage to start playing without an account. Please note, that without a user account it is not possible to create new stashes or keep score of the stashes you have found.
</br></br>
If you wish to create new stashes and keep score of the stashes you have found, you need to create a user account and sign in. You can browse for stashes on the map view and get details of a specific stash by touching the stash area. You can select a stash you wish to hunt and it will be highlighted on the map. You can add new stashes to the map if there are no other stashes within a distance of 100 meters (328 feet) of your current location. Give your stash a cool name, write a short description and take a picture of the stash as a clue for the hunters.
